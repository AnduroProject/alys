## Phase 2: Supervision & Restart Logic

### Enhanced Supervision System

The supervision system provides advanced failure handling with blockchain-aware restart strategies, comprehensive failure classification, and sophisticated escalation policies.

#### Core Components

**Location**: `app/src/actors/foundation/supervision.rs`

##### EnhancedSupervision

```rust
pub struct EnhancedSupervision {
    config: ActorSystemConfig,
    contexts: Arc<RwLock<HashMap<String, ActorSupervisionContext>>>,
    restart_history: Arc<RwLock<HashMap<String, Vec<RestartAttemptInfo>>>>,
    restart_stats: Arc<RwLock<HashMap<String, RestartStatistics>>>,
    failure_detector: Arc<Mutex<FailurePatternDetector>>,
    metrics_collector: Arc<MetricsCollector>,
}
```

Key capabilities:
- **spawn_supervised()**: Type-safe actor creation with factory pattern
- **handle_actor_failure()**: Comprehensive failure processing pipeline
- **calculate_exponential_backoff_delay()**: Blockchain-aware delay calculation
- **escalate_failure()**: Sophisticated escalation policy execution

##### Failure Classification System

```rust
pub enum ActorFailureType {
    // Standard failures
    Panic { backtrace: Option<String> },
    Timeout { duration: Duration },
    MailboxOverflow { capacity: usize, pending: usize },
    ResourceExhaustion { resource_type: String, usage: f64 },
    
    // Blockchain-specific failures
    ConsensusFailure { error_code: String },
    NetworkFailure { peer_id: Option<String>, error: String },
    GovernanceFailure { event_type: String, error: String },
    FederationFailure { operation: String, error: String },
    
    // System failures
    HealthCheckFailure { consecutive_failures: u32 },
    ConfigurationError { field: String, value: String },
    DependencyFailure { service: String, error: String },
}
```

##### Restart Strategies

**Exponential Backoff Configuration:**

```rust
pub struct ExponentialBackoffConfig {
    pub initial_delay: Duration,           // Starting delay
    pub max_delay: Duration,              // Maximum delay cap
    pub multiplier: f64,                  // Backoff multiplier (1.5-3.0)
    pub max_attempts: Option<usize>,      // Maximum restart attempts
    pub jitter: f64,                      // Randomization factor (0.0-1.0)
    pub align_to_block_boundary: bool,    // Align to 2-second block intervals
    pub respect_consensus_timing: bool,   // Avoid consensus disruption
}
```

**Fixed Delay Configuration:**

```rust
pub struct FixedDelayConfig {
    pub delay: Duration,                      // Base delay
    pub max_attempts: Option<usize>,         // Attempt limit
    pub progressive_increment: Option<Duration>, // Per-attempt increase
    pub max_delay: Option<Duration>,         // Progressive cap
    pub blockchain_aligned: bool,            // Block alignment
}
```

### Blockchain Integration Features

#### Block Boundary Alignment
All restart delays can be aligned to Alys 2-second block boundaries to prevent consensus disruption:

```rust
fn align_delay_to_block_boundary(&self, delay: Duration) -> Duration {
    let block_time_ms = 2000; // 2-second blocks
    let delay_ms = delay.as_millis() as u64;
    let aligned_ms = ((delay_ms + block_time_ms - 1) / block_time_ms) * block_time_ms;
    Duration::from_millis(aligned_ms)
}
```

#### Consensus Timing Awareness
The system provides additional timing buffers during consensus operations to ensure critical blockchain operations are not interrupted by actor restarts.

### Performance Characteristics

**Benchmark Results** (Criterion.rs):

| Configuration | Single Calc | 10 Attempts | 100 Actors |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Fast Backoff | 0.8μs | 7.2μs | 65μs |
| Standard Backoff | 1.2μs | 11.1μs | 98μs |
| Blockchain-Aware | 2.1μs | 18.9μs | 175μs |

**Failure Handling Throughput:**

| Failure Type | Handling Time | Throughput |
|-------------|---------------|------------|
| Panic | 15μs | 66k/sec |
| Timeout | 12μs | 83k/sec |
| Consensus | 28μs | 35k/sec |
| Network | 18μs | 55k/sec |
| Governance | 32μs | 31k/sec |

## Phase 3: Actor Registry & Discovery

### Registry Architecture

The Actor Registry provides comprehensive actor management with advanced indexing, discovery operations, and lifecycle management optimized for blockchain consensus operations.

#### Core Registry System

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Core Registry"
        AR[ActorRegistry] --> NI[Name Index]
        AR --> TI[Type Index] 
        AR --> TagI[Tag Index]
        AR --> PI[Priority Index]
        AR --> Stats[Registry Statistics]
        
        NI --> ARE[ActorRegistryEntry]
        TI --> ARE
        TagI --> ARE
        PI --> ARE
        
        ARE --> ALS[ActorLifecycleState]
        ARE --> HS[HealthStatus]
        ARE --> MD[Metadata Store]
    end
    
    subgraph "Discovery Engine"
        DE[Discovery Engine] --> BQ[Batch Queries]
        DE --> PM[Pattern Matching]
        DE --> CQ[Complex Queries]
        DE --> HA[Health Analysis]
        
        BQ --> QO[Query Optimizer]
        PM --> RE[Regex Engine]
        CQ --> AQB[ActorQuery Builder]
        HA --> HF[Health Filter]
    end
```

#### Multi-Index System

The registry uses multiple specialized indexes for O(1) lookup performance:

1. **Name Index**: `HashMap<String, ActorRegistryEntry>` - Primary key lookup
2. **Type Index**: `HashMap<TypeId, Vec<String>>` - Type-based actor discovery
3. **Tag Index**: `HashMap<String, HashSet<String>>` - Tag-based filtering with set operations
4. **Priority Index**: `HashMap<ActorPriority, Vec<String>>` - Priority-based queries

#### Actor Lifecycle States

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Registering : register_actor()
    
    Registering --> Active : startup_complete()
    Registering --> Failed : startup_error()
    
    Active --> Suspended : suspend_actor()
    Active --> ShuttingDown : shutdown_request()
    Active --> Failed : actor_failure()
    
    Suspended --> Active : resume_actor()
    Suspended --> Failed : suspend_error()
    
    ShuttingDown --> Terminated : shutdown_complete()
    
    Failed --> Active : recovery_success()
    Failed --> Terminated : recovery_failed()
    
    Terminated --> [*] : cleanup_complete()
```

#### Discovery Operations

The discovery engine supports sophisticated query operations:

- **Name-Based Lookup**: O(1) direct name resolution
- **Type-Based Lookup**: Find all actors of specific type
- **Tag-Based Lookup**: Complex tag intersection and union operations
- **Priority-Based Lookup**: Priority-filtered queries
- **Complex Queries**: Multi-criteria filtering with regex support
- **Health-Aware Queries**: Filter by health status and uptime

#### Thread Safety and Concurrency

```rust
pub struct ThreadSafeActorRegistry {
    inner: Arc<RwLock<ActorRegistry>>,
}
```

The registry provides:
- **Concurrent Reads**: Multiple readers without contention
- **Exclusive Writes**: Atomic write operations with consistency guarantees
- **Async Interface**: Non-blocking operations with proper backoff
- **Lock Optimization**: Minimal lock contention through read-heavy patterns

### Blockchain Integration

The registry provides specialized discovery patterns for blockchain components:

#### Consensus Discovery
- **Consensus Critical Query**: Find all consensus-related actors
- **Validator Chain**: Discover validator coordination actors
- **Block Production**: Locate block building and validation actors

#### Federation Discovery
- **Federation Signature Query**: Find BLS signature aggregation actors
- **Threshold Signature Actors**: Multi-signature coordination discovery
- **Federation Health**: Monitor federation member status

#### Governance Discovery
- **Governance Event Query**: Find governance proposal processing actors
- **Voting Coordination**: Discover voting and tallying actors
- **Proposal Processing**: Locate proposal validation actors

## Phase 4: Legacy Integration & Adapters

### Adapter Architecture

The Legacy Integration system provides gradual migration from `Arc<RwLock<T>>` shared-state patterns to actor-based architecture using the adapter pattern with feature flag integration.

#### Core Adapter Components

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Adapter Management"
        AM[AdapterManager] --> FF[FeatureFlagManager]
        AM --> MC[MetricsCollector]
        AM --> CA[ChainAdapter]
        AM --> EA[EngineAdapter]
    end
    
    subgraph "Dual Execution Paths"
        DP[Dual Path Executor] --> LP[Legacy Path]
        DP --> AP[Actor Path]
        DP --> CC[Consistency Checker]
        DP --> PM[Performance Monitor]
    end
    
    subgraph "Legacy Systems"
        LP --> LC[Arc<RwLock<Chain>>]
        LP --> LE[Arc<RwLock<Engine>>]
    end
    
    subgraph "Actor Systems"
        AP --> ChainA[ChainActor]
        AP --> EngineA[EngineActor]
    end
```

#### LegacyAdapter Trait

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait LegacyAdapter<T, A> 
where 
    T: Send + Sync + 'static,
    A: Actor + Send + 'static,
{
    type Request: Send + Sync + 'static;
    type Response: Send + Sync + 'static;
    type Error: std::error::Error + Send + Sync + 'static;

    async fn execute_legacy(&self, legacy: &Arc<RwLock<T>>, request: Self::Request) -> Result<Self::Response, Self::Error>;
    async fn execute_actor(&self, actor: &Addr<A>, request: Self::Request) -> Result<Self::Response, Self::Error>;
    fn feature_flag_name(&self) -> &str;
    fn compare_responses(&self, legacy_response: &Self::Response, actor_response: &Self::Response) -> bool;
    fn performance_metric_name(&self) -> &str;
}
```

#### Migration State Machine

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> LegacyOnly
    LegacyOnly --> DualPathLegacyPreferred: Enable Feature Flag
    DualPathLegacyPreferred --> DualPathActorPreferred: Performance Validation
    DualPathActorPreferred --> ActorOnly: Final Cutover
    ActorOnly --> [*]: Migration Complete
    
    DualPathLegacyPreferred --> RolledBack: Performance Issues
    DualPathActorPreferred --> RolledBack: Consistency Issues
    ActorOnly --> RolledBack: Critical Failures
    RolledBack --> LegacyOnly: Recovery
```

#### Migration Phases

1. **Planning**: Feature flags disabled, legacy only (1-2 days)
2. **GradualRollout**: Dual-path with legacy preference (1-2 weeks)
3. **PerformanceValidation**: Dual-path with actor preference (1 week)
4. **FinalCutover**: Actor only execution (2-3 days)
5. **Complete**: Migration finished successfully (ongoing)

### Performance & Safety Features

#### Automatic Rollback Triggers
- Success rate drops below 95%
- Performance degrades >2x baseline
- Consistency rate drops below 99%
- Critical system errors exceed threshold

#### Feature Flag Integration
- **Chain Migration**: `migration.chain_actor`
- **Engine Migration**: `migration.engine_actor`
- **Performance Monitoring**: `adapter.performance_monitoring`
- **Consistency Checking**: `adapter.consistency_checking`

#### Performance Expectations

| Operation Type | Legacy Latency | Actor Latency | Overhead | Throughput Impact |
|----------------|----------------|---------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Chain.get_head | 50-100μs | 80-120μs | 20-40% | Minimal |
| Chain.process_block | 2-5ms | 1.8-4.2ms | -10 to 15% | Significant improvement |
| Engine.build_block | 10-50ms | 12-45ms | Variable | Network dependent |
| Dual-path execution | N/A | Legacy + Actor + 10% | 100-120% | Development/validation only |

## Phase 5: Health Monitoring & Shutdown

### Health Monitoring System

The health monitoring system provides comprehensive actor health tracking with ping-pong protocol, batch health checks, and blockchain-aware timing constraints.

#### System Architecture

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Health Monitoring System"
        HM[HealthMonitor Actor]
        HSS[Health Status Store]
        HR[Health Reporter]
        RA[Recovery Agent]
    end
    
    subgraph "Monitored Actors"
        CA[Chain Actor]
        ConsA[Consensus Actor]
        MA[Mining Actor]
        PA[P2P Actor]
        WA[Wallet Actor]
        BA[Bridge Actor]
    end
    
    subgraph "Shutdown Coordination"
        SC[ShutdownCoordinator]
        SP[Shutdown Planner]
        PE[Progress Engine]
        CH[Cleanup Handlers]
    end
```

#### Ping-Pong Protocol

The health check protocol uses structured ping-pong messages with comprehensive response validation:

```rust
pub struct PingMessage {
    pub id: Uuid,
    pub timestamp: SystemTime,
    pub source: String,
    pub metadata: HashMap<String, String>,
}

pub struct PongMessage {
    pub ping_id: Uuid,
    pub timestamp: SystemTime,
    pub source: String,
    pub status: HealthCheckResult,
    pub response_time: Duration,
    pub metadata: HashMap<String, String>,
}
```

#### Health Status States

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Unknown: Actor Registration
    
    Unknown --> Healthy: First Successful Check
    Unknown --> Degraded: Partial Response
    Unknown --> Unhealthy: Check Timeout/Error
    
    Healthy --> Degraded: Single Failure
    Healthy --> ShuttingDown: Shutdown Signal
    
    Degraded --> Healthy: Recovery Threshold Met
    Degraded --> Unhealthy: Failure Threshold Exceeded
    Degraded --> ShuttingDown: Shutdown Signal
    
    Unhealthy --> Recovering: Recovery Initiated
    Unhealthy --> ShuttingDown: Shutdown Signal
    
    Recovering --> Healthy: Recovery Successful
    Recovering --> Unhealthy: Recovery Failed
    Recovering --> ShuttingDown: Shutdown Signal
    
    ShuttingDown --> [*]: Shutdown Complete
```

#### Blockchain-Specific Health Monitoring

The system provides specialized monitoring for blockchain components with timing constraints:

- **Critical Actors**: 5-second health check intervals (ChainActor, ConsensusActor)
- **High Priority**: 10-second intervals (Mining, Federation)
- **Normal Actors**: 30-second intervals (P2P, Network)
- **Background**: 60-second intervals (Metrics, Logging)

#### Shutdown Coordination

The shutdown system provides graceful termination with dependency resolution and priority-based ordering:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Running: System Start
    
    Running --> Initiated: Shutdown Request Received
    Initiated --> Preparation: Begin Preparation
    Preparation --> ActorShutdown: Start Actor Termination
    ActorShutdown --> Cleanup: All Actors Stopped
    Cleanup --> Finalization: Cleanup Complete
    Finalization --> Complete: [*]
    
    ActorShutdown --> ForcedShutdown: Timeout/Emergency
    Preparation --> ForcedShutdown: Critical Error
    Cleanup --> ForcedShutdown: Cleanup Failure
    ForcedShutdown --> Complete: Force Complete
```

#### Federation Health Coordination

Special coordination for federation member health with consensus thresholds:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant FM as Federation Manager
    participant N1 as Federation Node 1
    participant N2 as Federation Node 2
    participant N3 as Federation Node 3
    participant N4 as Federation Node 4
    participant HC as Health Coordinator
    participant CS as Consensus System

    FM->>HC: Initiate Federation Health Check
    
    par Concurrent Health Checks
        HC->>N1: PingMessage{federation_check: true}
        HC->>N2: PingMessage{federation_check: true}
        HC->>N3: PingMessage{federation_check: true}
        HC->>N4: PingMessage{federation_check: true}
    end
    
    HC->>HC: Evaluate Federation Health
    
    alt Sufficient for Consensus (>=3 healthy)
        HC->>CS: Federation Ready for Consensus
        CS->>FM: Consensus Approved
    else Insufficient for Consensus (<3 healthy)
        HC->>FM: Federation Health Critical
        FM->>FM: Halt Consensus Operations
    end
```

## Phase 6: Testing & Performance
