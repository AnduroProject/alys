# Alys

Alys is a merged mined Bitcoin sidechain.

- Uses BTC as its base currency.
- Reaches consensus through aux PoW executed by Bitcoin miners and a federation.
- Facilitates a two-way peg between Bitcoin and the Alys sidechain through the federation members.

## Overview

On a high level, the repository consists of three parts:

- [app](./app): Contains a consensus client for block production and finalization and a federation client to process peg-in and peg-out transactions.
- [contracts](.contracts): Contains the smart contract for burning bridged BTC by users to trigger the peg-out process.
- [crates](./crates): Contains the logic for the peg-in and peg-out handling used by the app. It also contains the logic to interact with Bitcoin miners.
- [docs](./docs/src/README.md): Contains more information on the architecture.

## Prerequisites

- Install Rust `1.75.0` or higher: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
- Install Geth: https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/getting-started/installing-geth
- Install Bitcoin Core `25.0` or higher so that you have access to the `bitcoind` and `bitcoin-cli` commands:
    - MacOS: `brew install bitcoin`
    - Ubuntu: `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bitcoin/bitcoin && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install bitcoind`
    - Arch: `yay bitcoin-core`
    - Download a binary: https://bitcoin.org/en/download
- Install foundry: https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation
- Clone Alys repo:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:AnduroProject/Alys.git
cd Alys 
```

## Getting Started

We will describe how to run an Alys sidechain and execute a peg in and out. The sidechain will consist of a single local node, and the federation will have a single member.

### Geth and Bitcoin

We will start a single geth node and a Bitcoin regtest node.

```shell
# cleanup, init and run geth
./scripts/start_geth.sh
```

```shell
# in a new terminal start bitcoin
bitcoind -regtest -rpcuser=rpcuser -rpcpassword=rpcpassword -fallbackfee=0.002
```

### Alys node

Next, we start a single Alys node with the federation having exactly one member.

```shell
# dev (single node)

# From the Alys root directory
cargo run --bin app -- --dev
```

You will see that the node is producing blocks continuously.

<details>
<summary>Further details on AuxPoW submission</summary>

According to the target time of merged mining, eventually, a merged mining block bundle is added to the chain, finalizing the previously created blocks together with the federation's validation and signing of the AuxPoW.

In dev mode, we use an embedded miner to get the AuxPoW.

When the AuxPoW is not submitted, the node will stop producing blocks.

Block production will resume once the next valid AuxPoW is submitted.

</details>

### Peg-In

Next, we move funds from Bitcoin to Alys via the peg-in to be able to send transactions on the Alys sidechain.

#### Get the Deposit Address

From the running Alys node, we can get the federation deposit address via the `getdepositaddress` RPC:

```shell
curl --silent -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id":"1", "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method": "getdepositaddress", "params":[]}' http://localhost:3000 | jq -r .result
```

This returns the federation deposit address of your local Alys node, e.g.:

```
bcrt1p83w7fnutkcyy5zdknkh3kjah47jg2j6etltpa542wjd6chzj7yksyz0zqw
```

#### Send BTC to the Deposit Address

Next, we do a bit of bitcoin-cli magic to create an "Alys" wallet. We send some BTC on regtest from the Alys wallet to the federation deposit address and add an EVM account (`0x09Af4E864b84706fbCFE8679BF696e8c0B472201`) in an OP_RETURN field for which we know the private key (`0xb9176fa68b7c590eba66b7d1894a78fad479d6259e9a80d93b9871c232132c01`).

You can run this script to achieve the peg in. The script will automatically fetch the deposit address from the federation nodes.

```shell
# set the btc amount and evm address
EVM_ADDRESS="09Af4E864b84706fbCFE8679BF696e8c0B472201"
./scripts/regtest_pegin.sh "1.0" $EVM_ADDRESS

# OR use the $DEV_PRIVATE_KEY
./scripts/regtest_pegin.sh
```

The Alys node will automatically bridge the BTC.

#### Check that Funds are Allocated inAlys 

Run `cast` to check that the funds have been allocated. Note that on peg-in, satoshis (10^8) will be converted to wei (10^18) so you will see a lot more 0s for the bridge 1 BTC, i.e., 1 * 10^18 wei instead of 1 * 10^8 satoshis.

```shell
cast balance 0x09Af4E864b84706fbCFE8679BF696e8c0B472201 --rpc-url "localhost:8545"
> 1000000000000000000
```

### Peg-Out

Next up, we want to peg out.

#### Peg-out Funds

We are returning the funds to the Alys wallet we created in Bitcoin.

We can use the peg out contract set the genesis at address `0xbBbBBBBbbBBBbbbBbbBbbbbBBbBbbbbBbBbbBBbB`, see also the [genesis file](./data/genesis.json).

We are doing this from the CLI and will need to define a `PRIVATE_KEY` env.

- `PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key is `0xb9176fa68b7c590eba66b7d1894a78fad479d6259e9a80d93b9871c232132c01`. This is the private key to the address `0x09Af4E864b84706fbCFE8679BF696e8c0B472201` that we set for the peg in.

```shell
# set the private key and btc address
PRIVATE_KEY=0xb9176fa68b7c590eba66b7d1894a78fad479d6259e9a80d93b9871c232132c01
./scripts/regtest_pegout.sh $PRIVATE_KEY $BTC_ADDRESS

# OR just the private key
./scripts/regtest_pegout.sh $PRIVATE_KEY

# OR use the $DEV_PRIVATE_KEY
./scripts/regtest_pegout.sh

# check the last 3 transactions. The 2 last should be the mining reward to alys (with category "immature") and the 3rd last txs should be a normal receive tx from the foundation
bitcoin-cli -regtest -rpcuser=rpcuser -rpcpassword=rpcpassword listtransactions "*" 3
```

## Running an Alys Network

Above, we show how to run Alys with a single node and a single federation member. The dev setup is meant for ease of testing without having to set various parameters. For operating an Alys network with multiple federation members, we need to take more steps.

We will now run an Alys network with three federation members where each member will run a geth and Alys consensus client and share a Bitcoin node.

In practice, each federation member will run their own Bitcoin node.

### Keys

Each Alys node will require two keys:

- A Bitcoin key to participate in generating a deposit address on peg-in and to sign peg-out transactions.
- An Aura key to sign blocks.

An EVM account is also needed to receive fees, but the private key does not need to be supplied.

#### Generate Secure Keys

There are multiple ways to generate secure keys. We will not cover the different options here and trust operators to have an understanding of how to generate and protect secret keys.

Note: if you are choosing to create keys, the chain configuration file needs to be adjusted as described here: [Chain spec](#chain-spec).

#### Developer Keys

For development purposes on private test deployments, we recommend using dummy keys:

##### Testing Keys (Aura/EVM)

```

### Start Bitcoin

#### Regtest

```shell
bitcoind -regtest -rpcuser=rpcuser -rpcpassword=rpcpassword -fallbackfee=0.002
bitcoin-cli -regtest -rpcuser=rpcuser -rpcpassword=rpcpassword createwallet alys
bitcoin-cli -regtest -rpcuser=rpcuser -rpcpassword=rpcpassword loadwallet alys
bitcoin-cli -regtest -rpcuser=rpcuser -rpcpassword=rpcpassword generatetoaddress 101 $(bitcoin-cli -regtest -rpcuser=rpcuser -rpcpassword=rpcpassword -rpcwallet=alys getnewaddress)
```

#### Testnet

Note: this will sync the entire Bitcoin test network.

```shell
bitcoind -testnet -rpcuser=rpcuser -rpcpassword=rpcpassword
```

#### Mainnet

Note: this will sync the entire Bitcoin main network.

```shell
bitcoind -rpcuser=rpcuser -rpcpassword=rpcpassword
```

### Run Three Nodes

Each Alys node takes several arguments:

- `chain`: A chain configuration like [chain.json](./data/chain.json)
- `aura-secret-key`: The secret key used to sign blocks by the federation member.
- `geth-url`: The URL to the geth node for the Alys node.
- `db-path`: The path where the Alys blocks are stored.
- `wallet-path`: The Bitcoin wallet path.
- `bitcoin-secret-key`: The Bitcoin secret key generates the shared deposit address and processes peg-outs.
- `bitcoin-rpc-url`: The URL of the Bitcoin RPC.
- `bitcoin-rpc-user`: The Bitcoin RPC user.
- `bitcoin-rpc-pass`: The Bitcoin RPC password.
- `mine` (optional): Activates the in-built dummy miner. Don't set this if using with an actual miner. See [Mining](#mining) on how to connect a miner.

In our example, we are going to use dev keys. These can be replaced by generating custom keys as described above.

We need six terminals, two for each node.

### Mining

Note the `--mine` flag used above which enables an auto-miner that attempts to find and submit a solution for the PoW.

We also provide an RPC that provides two methods, `createauxblock` and `submitauxblock`, based on the Namecoin implementation. If you are a mining pool operator, use the default RPC port (`3000`, or configure `--rpc-port`) to fetch the target and hash from your authority or full-node and then submit the AuxPow.

Note as per the Marathon specs we currently check the third *or* fourth output of the coinbase transaction to extract the merged mining header, this differs from the original specification [here](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Merged_mining_specification#Merged_mining_coinbase) (and corresponding implementations) which expect this in the `scriptSig` of the first input. It is also assumed that this is the only data in the `scriptPubKey` and there are no other instructions or data pushes. Additionally, Marathon does not yet support the merkle construction so the header always contains the AuxPow hash instead of the merkle root.

For local development we also offer a minimal binary named `miner` that does the same thing as the in-process service but over RPC.

```shell
cargo run --bin miner -- --url "127.0.0.1:3000"
```

### Peg in and Peg out

The peg in and out procedures are the same as in the Getting Started guide above.

The main difference will be the changed federation deposit address, which is `bcrt1pyjrtzxpj7vzpjz6kvps5c2ajhkupt8qk22ncdpdz23wdl5j7dp8qexkr43` if using the dev keys.

## Full Node

Running a full node is similar to running a federation node. The main difference is that full nodes do not require an Aura or Bitcoin key since they are not signing blocks or Bitcoin transactions.

1. Start Bitcoin with the network you want to connect to via `bitcoind`.
2. Start geth via `NUM=0 ./scripts/start_geth.sh` (assuming you run the full node on a different machine. If running on the same machine as the three nodes, use `NUM=3 ./scripts/start_geth.sh`)
3. Start the full node assuming the full node runs on a seperate machine:

```shell
cargo run --bin app -- \
  --chain data/chain.json \ 
  --geth-url http://localhost:8551/ \
  --db-path .alys/chain_db0/ \
  --rpc-port 3000 \
  --wallet-path .alys/wallet0 \
  --bitcoin-rpc-url localhost:18332 \
  --bitcoin-rpc-user rpcuser \
  --bitcoin-rpc-pass rpcpassword \
  --bitcoin-network testnet \
  --remote-bootnode /ip4/BOOTNODE_IP/tcp/BOOTNODE_LIBP2P_PORT
```

- `BOOTNODE_IP`: To select a bootnode, get its public or private IP address.
- `BOOTNODE_LIBP2P_PORT`: There are two ways to get the p2p port.
    - You can find the listening port by running `lsof -Pn -i4` on the server running the bootnode.
    - Set the P2P port explicitly: You can set a dedicated p2p port on the federation node/bootnode by adding the argument `--p2p-port 55444` to set this to port `55444`. Make sure to pick a free port.

## Development

### Alys Node (Consensus Layer)

#### Build and Deploy

```shell
# cleanup, init and run geth
./scripts/start_geth.sh

# start bitcoin
bitcoind -regtest -rpcuser=rpcuser -rpcpassword=rpcpassword -fallbackfee=0.002

# dev (single node)
cargo run --bin app -- --dev
```

#### Test

Tests are self-contained such that none of the services need to run.

```shell
cargo test
```

#### Format

```shell
cargo fmt
```

### Smart Contracts

#### Build and Deploy

Go to the contracts folder.

```shell
cd ./contracts
```

The contracts folder contains only the bridge contract for the peg out. However, you can add any other smart contracts you may wish to add here.

Build and deploy.

```shell
forge build
```

#### Example ERC20

We are going to deploy an example ERC20 contract to show how to interact with the sidechain.

We are going to use our private key (`0xb9176fa68b7c590eba66b7d1894a78fad479d6259e9a80d93b9871c232132c01`) as a means to deploy the contract. Make sure the account belonging to this key has received funds via the peg-in procedure.

```shell
PRIVATE_KEY=0xb9176fa68b7c590eba66b7d1894a78fad479d6259e9a80d93b9871c232132c01
# constructor takes the name of the contract, the ticker, and the initial supply that is minted to the creator of the contract
forge create --rpc-url "http://127.0.0.1:8545" --private-key ${PRIVATE_KEY} src/MockErc20.sol:MockErc20 --json --constructor-args "HelloBitcoinContract" "HBC" 100000000000000000000000
```

This should result in something like:

```shell
{"deployer":"0x09Af4E864b84706fbCFE8679BF696e8c0B472201","deployedTo":"0x1C36129916E3EA2ACcD516Ae92C8f91deF7c4146","transactionHash":"0x8478bbed6ba658eecb8e36c143969cf6c11c4517f5f32acf75af5a9c41ac69dd"}
```


Other useful scripts:

```shell
# Send some of the ERC20 tokens from the deployed contract (0x1C36129916E3EA2ACcD516Ae92C8f91deF7c4146) to account 0xd362E49EE9453Bf414c35288cD090189af2B2C55
cast send --private-key ${PRIVATE_KEY} \
  --rpc-url "localhost:8545" \
  --chain 263634 \
  0x1C36129916E3EA2ACcD516Ae92C8f91deF7c4146 \
  "transfer(address,uint256)" 0xd362E49EE9453Bf414c35288cD090189af2B2C55 100000000
# Send 16200000000007550 wei bridged BTC to account 0xd362E49EE9453Bf414c35288cD090189af2B2C55
cast send --private-key ${PRIVATE_KEY} 0xd362E49EE9453Bf414c35288cD090189af2B2C55 --value 16200000000007550
```

#### Test

```shell
forge test

## EVM Tooling

Since we use Geth without modification, it is already possible to use most existing EVM tooling out-the-box including MetaMask, Foundry / Hardhat and of course Blockscout!

### Blockscout

To setup [Blockscout](https://github.com/blockscout/blockscout) follow the deployment guides [here](https://docs.blockscout.com/for-developers/deployment). We recommend using [Docker Compose](https://github.com/docker/compose) for simplicity. 

```shell
git clone git@github.com:blockscout/blockscout.git
cd ./docker-compose
```

Change the environment variables:

```
# /docker-compose/envs/common-blockscout.yml
SUBNETWORK=Merged ALYS
CHAIN_ID=263634
# /docker-compose/envs/common-frontend.yml
NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK_NAME=Merged ALYS Alpha	
NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK_SHORT_NAME=Merged ALYS Alpha
```

Start the explorer with:

```shell
docker-compose -f geth.yml up --build
```

The explorer runs on [localhost:80](http://localhost/).

If you reset the chain make sure to clear the persistent data in `docker-compose/services/`.

```shell
sudo rm -rf services/redis-data services/stats-db-data services/blockscout-db-data services/logs
```

## Genesis

We provide [`genesis.json`](./data/genesis.json) for local development using Geth but it is also possible to use this other deployments.

It was previously based on the Sepolia genesis with some modifications using [this guide](https://dev.to/q9/how-to-merge-an-ethereum-network-right-from-the-genesis-block-3454):

```shell
geth --sepolia dumpgenesis | jq .
```

Ensure that the chain is configured to start post-capella (set `shanghaiTime` to 0).

The Alys sidechain expects the bridge contract to be pre-deployed at `0xbBbBBBBbbBBBbbbBbbBbbbbBBbBbbbbBbBbbBBbB`, this is set in `alloc`.

## Chain Spec

When you start the Alys sidechain it will use a chain spec to configure it's own genesis block based also on the Geth genesis configured above. We provide [`chain.json`](./data/chain.json) for local development assuming three nodes (instructions above) or using `--chain=dev` will start a single node network. See the annotations below for how to configure a new setup:

```json
{
    // the block duration in milliseconds
    "slotDuration": 2000,
    // public keys for bls signing
    "authorities": [],
    // evm addresses for each authority (to receive fees)
    "federation": [],
    // public keys for secp256k1 signing
    "federationBitcoinPubkeys": [],
    // initial PoW mining difficulty
    "bits": 553713663,
    // should be the same as the geth `genesis.json`
    "chainId": 263634,
    // stall block production if no AuxPow is received
    "maxBlocksWithoutPow": 10,
    // set the scanning height, use latest height for testnet or mainnet
    "bitcoinStartHeight": 0,
    "retargetParams": {
        // disable retargeting so we always keep the same target
        "powNoRetargeting": false,
        // the maximum target allowed
        "powLimit": 553713663,
        // expected difficulty adjustment period (in seconds)
        "powTargetTimespan": 12000,
        // expected block time (in seconds)
        "powTargetSpacing": 1000
    }
}
```

Each node should use the same genesis and chain spec, otherwise blocks will be rejected.

Ensure that each federation member has set an EVM address to receive fees - this can be derived from the same secret key used to generate the public key in `"authorities"`. When fees are generated from EVM transactions they are sent directly to that account.
